{"name":"Themes","tagline":"Quality, free Tumblr themes!","body":"### Welcome to Dune Themes\r\nDune Themes design and build bespoke, free Tumblr themes. Each theme is hand crafted, and built to an extremely high standard. All of which come with a plethora of customization and add-on features, designed to make your blog stand out!\r\n\r\n### Growing\r\nDune Themes is constantly growing. We're always adding new themes, pages and add-ons to our directories. From here, you can download the entire collection using the links to the right. Or, you can pick and choose which ones you like by clicking the \"View project on GitHub\" button at the very top.\r\n\r\n### Customize\r\nAll our themes come with built-in customization options. What's more, we've written code that's designed to be modified. We encourage everyone who uses our themes to make their own changes, to bend and transform them. \r\n\r\n### Use\r\nAs stated above, we want you to modify the themes and the code as much as you like. We only ask that you leave the credit in the <head> of the code, and also leave the logo in the bottom right of the theme unchanged. That's it!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDune Themes is primarily moderated and run by [Samuel Stroud](http://twitter.com/Samuel_Stroud), with other designers contributing code or whole themes. All designers are credited in the code of the theme. \r\n\r\n### Support\r\nNeed a hand with the code? We have a dedicated page for handling any and all questions you may have, which you can find here - [http://dunethemes.tumblr.com/support](http://dunethemes.tumblr.com/support)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
